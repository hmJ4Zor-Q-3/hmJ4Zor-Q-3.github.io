                The expressed purpose of this website is to freely share information of any variety that I've produced. Be it tips, tricks, advice, articles, ideas or concepts, possibly possibly opinions, assets of any given kind, programs and tools, any source code, or anything else. I'm a believer in the dessimenation of free and open information, and helping others, this is the goal of the website to espouse.
                <br/>
                <br/>The website does also serve the secondary goal of providing a project for me to learn and practice various skills on.
